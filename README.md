#Algorithms

My implementations of some algorithms. Some practice before I take over the Universe.

##Usage
The files have a sample set of input and output at the top, and possibly comments regarding the implementation.

If the math libraries don't link properly, try using the -lm flag.

**e.g.:**

gcc -o dfs -lm dfs.c

./dfs &lt; dfs_inp
